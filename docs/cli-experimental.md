# Experimental Features

## Overview

These are the experimental features hidden behind feature flags that are currently available in azure-nuke. They are all
disabled by default. These are switches that changes the actual behavior of the tool itself. Changing the behavior of
a resource is done via resource settings.

!!! note
The original tool had configuration options called `feature-flags` which were used to enable/disable certain
behaviors with resources, those are now called settings and `feature-flags` have been deprecated in the config.

## Usage

```console
azure-nuke run --feature-flag "wait-on-dependencies"
```

**Note:** other CLI arguments are omitted for brevity.

## Available Feature Flags

- `filter-groups` - This feature flag will cause azure-nuke to filter based on a grouping method which allows for AND'ing
  filters together.
- `wait-on-dependencies` - This feature flag will cause azure-nuke to wait for all resource type dependencies to be
  deleted before deleting the next resource type.

### wait-on-dependencies

This feature flag will cause azure-nuke to wait for all resource type dependencies to be deleted before deleting the next
resource type. This is useful for resources that have dependencies on other resources. For example, an IAM Role that has
an attached policy.

The problem is that if you delete the IAM Role first, it will fail because it has a dependency on the policy.

This feature flag will cause azure-nuke to wait for all resources of a given type to be deleted before deleting the next
resource type. This will reduce the number of errors and unnecessary API calls.

### filter-groups

This feature flag will cause azure-nuke to filter resources based on a group method. This is useful when filters need
to be AND'd together. For example, if you want to delete all resources that are tagged with `env:dev` and `namespace:test`
you can use the following filter group:

```yaml
filters:
  ResourceType:
    - property: tag:env
      value: dev
      group: group1
    - property: tag:namespace
      value: test
      group: group2
```
